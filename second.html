            <h1>Welcome to New Zealand Culture</h1>
            <div class="culture-text">
                <p>The New Zealand culture is open-minded and welcoming to people of all countries and cultures. As a
                    country we value kindness, tolerance and friendship. We’re open-minded and welcoming toward all
                    religions and uphold the right to freedom of religion, worship and belief for all. Kiwis expect
                    everyone
                    to be treated fairly and they enjoy feeling safe in their homes and in public places.</p>

                <p>New Zealanders are generally relaxed, positive people who love to work hard, spend time with friends
                    and
                    family and enjoy the beautiful country they live in. New Zealanders – or Kiwis, as they’re often
                    known –
                    balance time at work with time to relax and unwind. They love exploring the outdoors, playing or
                    watching sport, engaging in art and culture, and generally making the most of life. They’re friendly
                    and
                    open-minded, but can sometimes seem a bit reserved and shy.</p>

                <p>There may be many things that are different to your home country here. From our public holidays to
                    our
                    celebrations. The more you experience here, the better you'll understand our culture!</p>

                        differ between tribes.
                        Symbols include the tiki, which represents the human figure, and the manaia, a creature with a
                        bird-like head and serpent-like body, associated with guardianship.
                        Traditional patterns used in carving were often inspired by the natural environment, including
                        spider webs (pungawerewere), fish scales (unaunahi) and the unfurling fronds of the fern (koru).
